# project 4e03

## status: support for E4, S4 and M4 is complete

This project is an attempt to develop an alternate firmware for the Epilot E4 powerbank. Epilot E4 is a smart powerbank that is capable of replacing its 4 18650 battery cells. It utilizes an atmega168pa to control and monitor the charging of each individual cell, so that salvaged cells can be mixed in use.
